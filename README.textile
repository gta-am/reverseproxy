h1. ReverseProxy module for Play!

h2. What is ReverseProxy?

ReverseProxy switches between HTTP and HTTPS schemes by using a frontend *Reverse-Proxy* server,
e.g., Nginx, Apache, Lighttpd.

h2. Requirements

* A Reverse-Proxy server configured
* For SSL, a *certificate* and its *key*

h2. Configuration

Set the following properties in conf/application.conf

    reverse_proxy.enable=true

    reverse_proxy.http.address=127.0.0.1

    reverse_proxy.http.port=80

    reverse_proxy.https.port=443

* reverse_proxy.enable - For enabling or disabling the switching between the Play-App and the Reverse-Proxy.
* reverse_proxy.http.address - The Reverse-Proxy address.
* reverse_proxy.http.port - The Reverse-Proxy HTTP listening port.
* reverse_proxy.https.port - The Reverse-Proxy HTTPS listening port.

h2. Usage

Add this module to your dependecy.yml file
sfgfsghjfkh

h2. HTTPS support

In order to communicate between Reverse-Proxy server and Play built-in server either by HTTP or HTTPS protocol,
Play needs Java keystore or simple cert and key files and _since you have to create Certificate and its Key for the Reverse-Proxy server,
you can use the same ones_.
To start an HTTPS connector for your application, just declare the https.port configuration property in your application.conf file:

bc. http.port=9000
https.port=9443

You need to put your certificates in the conf directory. Play supports X509 certificates and keystore certificates. The X509 certificates must be named as follow:
host.cert for the certificate and host.key for the key. If you are using keystore, then, by default it should be named certificate.jks.

If you are using X509 certificates, then the following parameters can be configured though your application.conf:

bc. # X509 certificates
certificate.key.file=conf/host.key
certificate.file=conf/host.cert
# In case your key file is password protected
certificate.password=secret
trustmanager.algorithm=JKS

In case your are using keystore:
bc. keystore.algorithm=JKS
keystore.password=secret
keystore.file=conf/certificate.jks

Note that the values above are the default values.

You can generate self signed certificates using openssl:
openssl genrsa 1024 > host.key
openssl req -new -x509 -nodes -sha1 -days 365 -key host.key > host.cert

If you are using the java keystore mechanism, then the following properties can be configured in your application.conf:

bc. # Keystore
ssl.KeyManagerFactory.algorithm=SunX509
trustmanager.algorithm=JKS
keystore.password=secret
keystore.file=certificate.jks

The values above are the default values.
